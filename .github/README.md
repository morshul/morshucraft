# Minecraft

Trying to recreate the Minecraft engine in C#.

## Requirements

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- When running on Windows 7 or 8.1, [additional prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60&pivots=os-windows#dependencies)* may be required to correctly run .NET 7 applications if your operating system is not up-to-date with the latest service packs.
- When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intellisense and syntax highlighting, such as [Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [neovim](https://neovim.io/).
